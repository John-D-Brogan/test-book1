title: Publishing

To get your Quarto webpage to show up with the url
```
yourname.github.io/yourrepo
```
you have a few steps.

## Turn on GitHub Pages for your repo

* Turn on GitHub Pages under Settings > Pages . You will set pages to be made from the gh-pages branch and the root directory.
* Turn on GitHub Actions under Settings > Actions > General

The GitHub Action will automatically recreate your website when you push to GitHub **after** you do the initial `gh-pages` set-up

## Do your first publish to `gh-pages`

The first time you publish to `gh-pages`, you need to do so locally.

* On your local computer, open a terminal window and `cd` to your repo directory. Here is what that `cd` command looks like for me. You command will look different because your local repo will be somewhere else on your computer.
```
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/NOAA-quarto-simple
```
* Publish to the `gh-pages`. In the terminal type
```
quarto publish gh-pages
```
This is going to render your webpage and then push the `_site` contents to the `gh-pages` branch.


## Don't like using `gh-pages`?

In some cases, you don't want your website on the `gh-pages` branch. For example, if you are creating releases and you want the website pages in that release, then you won't want your website pages on the `gh-pages` branch.

Here are the changes you need to make if you to avoid `gh-pages` branch.

* At the top of `_quarto.yml` add the following:
```
project: 
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
```
* On GitHub under Settings > Pages set pages to be made from the `main` branch and the docs directory.
* Make sure `docs` is not listed in `.gitignore`
* Publish the site the first time locally using `quarto publish` from the terminal
* Update the GitHub Action by changing the target branch from `gh-pages` to `main`
